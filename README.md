# Smart-Start
## Project Overview:

### Existing Issues
The current onboarding process for new IBM employees is fragmented and time-consuming, leading to a suboptimal experience for new hires and increased workload for managers. New employees often struggle with setting up tools, requesting access to necessary resources, scheduling introductory meetings, and finding relevant project documentation. This inefficient process can delay their time to productivity and hinder team integration.

### Proposed Solution
The Onboarding Agent, developed using IBM's watsonx Orchestrate platform, aims to address these issues by streamlining and personalizing the onboarding experience for new IBM employees. This AI-powered digital concierge automates key workflows, provides contextual guidance, and proactively assists new hires throughout the onboarding journey.

### Role of AI in the Solution
Agentic AI plays a crucial role in this solution, enabling the Onboarding Agent to autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Through AI, the agent can:

1. Analyze new hires' backgrounds and project needs to tailor recommendations.
2. Adapt to individual user profiles and learn from interactions, improving recommendations over time.
3. Autonomously handle access requests, tool setup, meeting scheduling, and buddy matching.

### Benefits and Anticipated Outcomes
By implementing the Onboarding Agent, we anticipate the following outcomes:

1. Enhanced new hire experience: A seamless, personalized onboarding journey that reduces time and effort.
2. Improved team integration: Better collaboration and communication through facilitated introductions.
3. Increased productivity: Quick contribution to projects with immediate access to tools and resources.
4. Reduced manager workload: Automation of routine tasks, freeing up managers for strategic initiatives.
5. Scalability and consistency: Handling a large volume of new hires simultaneously with a high-quality onboarding experience.

By leveraging AI-powered automation, the Onboarding Agent will revolutionize the IBM new employee onboarding process, ensuring a smooth transition into the organization and accelerating their path to productivity.

## Technical Statement
Leveraging the power of the watsonx Orchestrate platform, our multi-agent architecture employs specialized agents for various onboarding functions, ensuring a seamless and efficient integration experience.

The key agents in our system include:

1. **Tool Suggestion Agent**: This agent identifies and facilitates the installation of necessary tools, drawing data from sources like GitHub, Box Notes, and internal systems.

2. **Access Request Agent**: Automates access provisioning for various tools, repositories, Slack channels, and applications. It analyzes access patterns and generates requests via AccessHub or email templates.

3. **Meeting Scheduler Agent**: This agent arranges meetings with managers, buddies, and team members, taking into account calendar availability and room booking systems.

4. **Project Overview Agent**: Summarizes project context, tech stack, and team structure, recommending learning materials based on the user's CV and project needs.

5. **Orchestration Agent**: As the central coordinator, this agent triggers relevant agents based on user metadata and maintains progress tracking.

6. **Onboarding Chat UI**: A conversational interface for users to interact with the system naturally.

Our solution integrates with diverse data sources, such as user CVs, team structures, access logs, documentation metadata, and tech stack inventories. It harnesses capabilities like natural language understanding, task orchestration, calendar parsing, access automation, and document summarization.

To ensure security, we employ role-based access control, audit logging, and adherence to IBM data governance policies.
